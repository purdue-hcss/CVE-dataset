# CVE Dataset Repository

## Overview
This repository contains a dataset of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) entries. Each entry in the dataset provides detailed information about specific security vulnerabilities that have been publicly disclosed. The dataset is formatted in JSON, making it suitable for use in security research and development projects.

## Dataset Structure
Each entry in the JSON dataset is structured as follows:

```json
{
    "cve_id": "CVE-YYYY-NNNN",
    "cwe_id": "CWE-ID",
    "cve_description": "description of the vulnerability",
    "cvss_score": "numeric CVSS score or empty if not available",
    "cpe_items": [
        "cpe:/:a:vendor:product:version:...:...",
        ...
    ]
}
```
